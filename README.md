# Mini-Projects
<h2>Calculator</h2>
<p> I made a Calculator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<p>In this JavaScript Calculator Project, I first create the UI design of Calculator using HTML CSS and then I used JavaScript to add the functionality to the calculator.</p>

<h2>Analog-Clock</h2>
<p>A clock is known as an analogue clock when it has moving hands and is usually (hours) marked from 1 to 12 to show you the time of the day.</p>

<p>• It is a simple file having the basic structure of the webpage and ID for the clock’s body and for the second, minute, hour hands.<br>
• The CSS is used just for making the clock actually look a bit nicer. I have basically centered our clock in the middle of the webpage.<br>
• The JavaScript will provide the logic behind the rotation of the hands. </p>

<h2>Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>

<p>Tic Tac Toe is a multiplayer game and the players of this game have to position their marks(sign) so that they can construct a continuous line of three cells or boxes vertically,horizontally or diagonally.</p>
